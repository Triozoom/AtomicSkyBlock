# AtomicSkyBlock
 Remake of the OneBlock map by IJAMinecraft in SpigotMC 1.16+.
 Depends on TitleManagerAPI.
 Messages are in **portuguese** since I'm from Brazil. I'll consider making a language file to make the plugin better accessible but I'm tired asf so don't expect much.
 Phases are hard-coded. I really don't want to make them configurable since I'm a procastinating, tired and dumb shit.
 This plugin is kinda dead because I used to play this with my friends and they're gone so... uh, yeah. Jokes on me I guess!
