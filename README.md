# AtomicSkyBlock
 Remake of the OneBlock map by IJAMinecraft in SpigotMC 1.16+.
 Depends on TitleManagerAPI. Can hook into AtomAchievements.
 Messages are in **portuguese** since I'm from Brazil. I will ~~consider~~ *NOT* be making a language file to make the plugin better accessible. ~~(but I'm tired asf so don't expect much.)~~
 Phases are hard-coded. I really don't want to make them configurable since I'm a procastinating, tired and dumb shit.
 ~~This plugin is kinda dead because I used to play this with my friends and they're gone so... uh, yeah. Jokes on me I guess!~~ Added new things for no absolute god damn reason but yeah
